**🗺️ Just built an Intent-Based Maps Search MVP that understands natural language queries instead of keywords!**

**Instead of typing "coffee near me", you can now say:**
*"Find me a quiet coffee shop halfway between my office and client meeting with parking"*

**And it actually understands:**
✅ Place type: coffee shop  
✅ Locations: office + client meeting  
✅ Constraints: quiet + parking  
✅ Logic: calculate midpoint  

**Try the LIVE DEMO here:** 🔗 **[YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL]**

**Example queries to test:**
- "Find restaurants in Palo Alto with good ratings"
- "Coffee shops halfway between San Francisco and San Jose with parking"
- "Quiet cafes near Stanford University"
- "Bars in downtown San Francisco open late"

**Why this matters:**
🧠 **Natural language** beats keyword searches  
🎯 **Intent understanding** provides better results  
📍 **Context awareness** (midpoints, constraints)  
⚡ **Immediate value** for professionals and travelers  

**Built with:** Python, Streamlit, NLP, and mock Google Maps API

**This could revolutionize how we search for places!** What do you think? Would you use this for finding meeting spots or travel planning?
